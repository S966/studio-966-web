      Yes, working with ALBAIK is as fun as it sounds. It's not just a company that makes the best fried chicken in the world, but also deeply cares about its social responsibility and their customer's experience.
    %p
      When your brand has this much reach, designing a digital solution to enhance customer's experience requires extensive UX research to insure the best possible outcomes. First a comprehensive look at the customer profile and their needs, followed by  wireframing of the main tasks and testing them with a wide range of different customer profiles; then, a tightly integerated responsive web application. 
      
    %p
      Through an iterative process of testing, measuring, and designing, we arrived to a digital solution that ALBAIK & Studio 966 are proud of.
