* Experimental support for multiple blogs in a single site by activating
  `:blog` multiple times.
* Works as a Middleman 3.1-style extension.
* Add `:blog_name`, `:blog_author`, `:blog_avatar` options and a `page_title` helper
  that incorporates `:blog_name`.
* Allow options.sources to contain the same date component multiple
  times. #112
* Improve `feed.xml.builder` template to support `blog.prefix`. #126
* Hide page numbers in template if only one page per index. #125
* URLs in the feed.xml template are now absolute. #130
* ASCII-8BIT text is reencoded to UTF-8 to avoid Nokogiri problems when
  generating summaries.
* `summary` will no longer explode when encountering comments in the
  article. #136
* Fix setting time zone with `set :time_zone` in `config.rb`. #140
* Articles can omit their :title from the filename and specify it in frontmatter
  instead. #148

3.2.0
====

* The `summary` method on articles is now HTML-aware, and can be provided with
  a different summary length or ellipsis string: `summary(1000, '&hellip;')`. 
  Nokogiri is required to use the summary.
* The `summary_generator` option now recieves the rendered article (without
  layout) instead of the template source.
* Set `summary_length` to false to always use the full article as a summary.
* Future-dated articles can still be generated if `publish_future_dated` is true.
* The `summary_separator` option no longer needs to have a capturing group, or
  even be a regexp.
